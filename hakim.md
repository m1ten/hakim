# Hakim

## Backstory

In a future where **time travel** has become a reality, the world has discovered the ability to traverse different eras of history. Amara, once a myth, has emerged as a flourishing, advanced city-state that has discovered how to regulate this temporal travel. As **Hakim of Amara**, you are entrusted with the crucial responsibility of managing the immigration border, ensuring that people from various points in time do not bring dangerous diseases that could threaten the health of your people.

For seven days, Amara has opened its gates to individuals from across history. Each day, a new era presents itself, bringing with it unique diseases that once ravaged humanity. As the Hakim, you must use your medical knowledge, historical context, and critical thinking skills to examine the health status of these time travelers and make tough decisions to keep Amara disease-free.

However, you are not alone in this task. The **Wazir**, the governing head of Amara, will issue daily **mandates** requiring certain individuals or groups to be allowed entry, regardless of their health status. These mandates can complicate your decisions, as some mandates may conflict with the health requirements of your citizens.

The fate of Amara lies in your hands, and you must balance public health concerns with the political pressures of running an advanced society. Will you be able to protect Amara from historical epidemics, or will you risk the downfall of your civilization?

## Gameplay Overview

### Time Periods

Each day in the game represents a different historical period. Immigrants from that period arrive at Amara’ gates, and it is your job to examine their health documents, symptoms, and history to determine whether or not they are allowed in. The diseases of these time periods are your greatest threat, as you must identify infected individuals and prevent them from entering Amara.

- **Day 1: Ancient Egypt**

  - **Common Diseases**: Malaria, Tuberculosis
  - **Historical Context**: Ancient Egypt, with its grand pyramids and Nile River, had a population susceptible to diseases spread by mosquitoes and poor sanitation. Malaria was common in this era due to the marshy areas along the Nile, and tuberculosis was prevalent in densely populated areas.

- **Day 2: Medieval Europe**

  - **Common Diseases**: The Black Death (Bubonic Plague)
  - **Historical Context**: The Black Death devastated Europe in the 14th century, killing an estimated 25 million people. Bubonic plague, spread by fleas on rats, spread rapidly through European cities, causing widespread panic and social upheaval.

- **Day 3: The Renaissance**

  - **Common Diseases**: Syphilis, Smallpox
  - **Historical Context**: The Renaissance was a time of great cultural advancement, but it was also marked by the spread of diseases like syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection that was rampant during the time. Smallpox also ravaged populations, causing high mortality.

- **Day 4: Victorian England**

  - **Common Diseases**: Cholera, Tuberculosis
  - **Historical Context**: The Industrial Revolution brought about crowded, unsanitary living conditions in Victorian England. Cholera, spread through contaminated water, and tuberculosis, which spread through the air, were two of the most deadly diseases of the era.

  - **Common Diseases**: Influenza
  - **Historical Context**: The Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918-1919 infected about a third of the world’s population and caused millions of deaths. The virus spread quickly, and with limited medical knowledge and resources, it was devastating.

- **Day 6: 1970s**

  - **Common Diseases**: HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis
  - **Historical Context**: The 1970s saw the rise of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which would go on to cause a global pandemic. The 1970s also witnessed the rise of Hepatitis, which became a major concern, particularly in the context of blood transfusions and intravenous drug use.

- **Day 7: Modern Day**
  - **Common Diseases**: COVID-19, Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis
  - **Historical Context**: The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in 2019, spread globally, disrupting economies and societies. In addition, the rise of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the modern era has presented new challenges for public health systems around the world.

## Game Mechanics

### Examine Immigrants

Each day, individuals from the historical time period will arrive at the immigration checkpoint. You must examine the following:

- **Health Documents**: Check for any signs of diseases or past illnesses.
- **Symptoms**: Pay close attention to the traveler’s physical symptoms, such as fever, coughing, or rashes, which may indicate infection.
- **History**: Review the individual’s background and place of origin to see if they may have been exposed to any known epidemics from their time period.

### Mandates

Every day, a new mandate is issued by the **Wazir**, which may dictate the entry of specific individuals, such as royals or diplomats, from certain time periods. These mandates override your normal examination process, and failure to comply with the mandate may result in penalties.

For example, one mandate may require all **royals from Victorian England** to be allowed in, regardless of their health status. This can create moral dilemmas, as you may need to decide whether to allow sick royals into Amara, despite the potential risks.

### Decision-making

Each time an immigrant arrives, you must make a decision:

- **Approve**: If the individual is healthy, you approve their entry into Amara, earning **+1** score.
- **Deny**: If the individual is infected or suspected of carrying a dangerous disease, you deny their entry, preventing the spread of disease.

However, if you allow someone infected with a deadly disease to enter Amara, it will result in a **-2 penalty** to your score. If you deny entry to someone who is healthy, your score will also drop.

### Time Pressure

You have a limited amount of time each day to review documents and make decisions. Each day represents one turn, and if you do not make decisions quickly enough, Amara may suffer from the consequences of allowing diseases to spread. If you run out of time and Amara becomes overwhelmed by disease, you will lose your position as Hakim.

### Health and Trust

Your main objective is to maintain the **health of Amara** while managing the political pressures of ruling an advanced society. You must balance the need to control diseases with the desire to meet the demands of the Wazir.

At the end of each day, your **score** is updated based on the decisions you made. A high score reflects your success in preventing disease outbreaks, while a low score means you have failed to protect Amara.

## End Goal

The ultimate goal of the game is to keep Amara free from diseases over the course of seven days. You must make difficult choices based on historical knowledge, health assessments, and political mandates. If you succeed in keeping Amara safe, you will be hailed as a hero. If you fail, you will be removed from your position as Hakim, and Amara will fall to the ravages of time-traveling diseases.

Will you be able to navigate the complexities of time-traveling immigration and preserve the health of Amara, or will you fall victim to the diseases of the past?
